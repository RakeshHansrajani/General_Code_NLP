# General Code for Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a versatile code file for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The code covers a wide spectrum of preprocessing and analysis steps, facilitating effective text mining and feature engineering. Whether you're working on sentiment analysis, text classification, or any NLP project, this code provides a robust foundation.

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:
1. Lowercase Conversion: Ensure consistent case for all text data.
2. HTML Tag Removal: Strip out HTML tags to extract clean text.
3. URL Removal: Eliminate website URLs to enhance text clarity.
4. Punctuation Removal: Removing text of punctuation marks to streamline analysis.
5. Chat Slangs Treatment: Normalize chat slangs for standardized text processing.
6. Spell Correction: Correct spelling errors to improve text quality.
7. Stopword Removal: Exclude common stopwords(am, an the, etc.) to focus on meaningful content.
8. Emoji Removal: Eliminate emojis to simplify text for analysis.
9. Emoji-to-Text Conversion: Translate emojis into textual representation for meaningful analysis..
10. Word Tokenization: Segment text into individual words.
11. Sentence Tokenization: Break text into sentences for deeper analysis.
12. Stemming: Reduce words to their root form for linguistic consistency.
13. Lemmatization: Transform words to their base or dictionary form.
14. Vectorization: Utilize one-hot encoding, Bag of words and TF-IDF for feature representation.
15. WordCloud Visualization: Generate WordCloud visualizations for insightful data exploration.
